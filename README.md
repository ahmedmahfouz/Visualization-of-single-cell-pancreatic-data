# Visualization-of-single-cell-pancreatic-data
A RShiny app is designed for visualization the created comprehensive pancreatic atlas:
Seven publicly availible scRNA-seq pancreatic datasets are integrated by Seurat V3. 

For running the tool the user needs to download the server and UI file, also the
AverageExpression_DonorInformation and DataFrame_incl_Genes files need to be downloaded 
by using the following link:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3941266.
Then all the files need to be stored in a directory of choice, the path name of the last
two files need to be set in the server and UI file so the files can be used. 
The web tool can run locally at the user's RStudio application.
